## Hi there 👋

I am currently developing my programming skills alongside my job. Together with my growing knowledge in networking, this is my path into the world of IT.

Currently I am working on two projects: 
1. A small Python port scanner to compare the efficiency of my code in Python.
2. Building my own WEB Server with Nginx.
